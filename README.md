# AH-Module
  This repository houses a monolithic module that contains code necessary to render "AirBnB's" "More Homes you May Like" component. 
  
  The module will display a row of "homes" (records) that are of similar price or location relative to the listing listed and currently on view. Each record displays basic profile information of the record, including the listing title, picture, nightly price, average reviews, stars, the number of beds, and whether it's a private or shared room.
  
  It also allows you to horizontally scroll through the listings to view multiple records.
